  Hi, my name's Ersain and I'm a software developer and computer engineering enthusiast.

  Skills: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Django</mark>, <mark>Django REST Framework</mark>, <mark>PostgreSQL</mark>
  
  Tools: <mark>Git</mark>, <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>

  Familiar: <mark>Javascript</mark>, <mark>HTML/CSS3</mark>, <mark>Flask</mark>, <mark>FastAPI</mark>, <mark>Bash Scripting</mark>, <mark>Machine Learning</mark>,

  My GitHub is more like a project graveyard of half-finished, half-assed projects than a set of project repositories that showcase my skills.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
